# pi-loom — Implementation Plan

Companion to [`spec.md`](./spec.md). The plan is a set of per-phase leaf pages under [`plan_topics/`](./plan_topics/). An implementer working on a single leaf only needs to open that leaf's page plus the spec topics it references.

## How to use this plan

1. Read [`plan_topics/conventions.md`](./plan_topics/conventions.md) once — it covers the three phase categories (horizontal / MVP / vertical), the per-phase TDD ritual, the leaf format, and the project-wide cross-cutting rules.
2. Author new leaves by copying [`plan_topics/leaf-template.md`](./plan_topics/leaf-template.md) and saving under `plan_topics/<id>-<short-name>.md`. Link the new leaf into the appropriate section below. If the new leaf can introduce an executable REQ-ID, a citing test that *closes* a coverage-matrix-mapped numbered REQ-ID, or an un-anchored normative MUST, add it to [`H5b`](./plan_topics/H5b-warn-only-canary.md)'s **Deps** per [`conventions.md`](./plan_topics/conventions.md) §REQ-ID discipline (*Transitive-completeness plan-maintenance*), which states that obligation once and governs its exact triggers.
3. Pick the next leaf whose **Deps** are satisfied. Open that leaf's page; read only the leaf and the spec topic(s) listed under its **Spec** field.
4. Follow the per-phase TDD ritual. MVP and vertical features are two paired tasks — land the tests task `<id>-T` first (tag `<id>-T-complete`), then the implementation task `<id>` (tag `<id>-complete` when its **Ships when** condition is observable). Horizontal leaves are a single task tagged `<id>-complete`.
5. Maintain [`plan_topics/coverage-matrix.md`](./plan_topics/coverage-matrix.md) so every executable spec REQ-ID has at least one closing leaf by the loom 1.0 release gate, whose non-gating→gating activation is owned by the terminal [`H6a`](./plan_topics/H6a-live-corpus-activation.md) leaf.

## Scope

**In scope.** This plan implements loom 1.0 as defined by [`spec.md`](./spec.md) and its topics. Every leaf traces to a spec REQ-ID, or — for horizontal leaves — to a [`conventions.md`](./plan_topics/conventions.md) section.

**Out of scope.** The loom 1.0 non-goals and deferred forward-compatibility seams are owned by the spec, not this plan: see [`spec.md` — Scope](./spec/overview-and-orientation.md#scope) and [Future Considerations — loom 1.0 non-goals](./spec_topics/future-considerations/model-changes-and-non-goals.md#v1-non-goals). No leaf implements a non-goal or a deferred seam; a step that appears to require one is scope creep — fix the spec first (per the **Spec drift** rule in [`conventions.md`](./plan_topics/conventions.md)) before planning it. Post-loom-1.0 surface extensions and model-level changes are likewise out of scope.

---

## Horizontal phases

Project scaffold, dependency-injection skeleton, diagnostics primitive, Pi-extension shell, end-to-end harness. Horizontal phases are infrastructure work — they operationalise [`conventions.md`](./plan_topics/conventions.md) rather than implement spec rules directly, so their leaves cite a **Convention.** field instead of a **Spec.** field.

- [`H1a` — Project scaffold and toolchain](./plan_topics/H1a-scaffold-and-toolchain.md)
- [`H2a` — Cross-cutting lint and architectural gates](./plan_topics/H2a-cross-cutting-gates.md)

- [`H7a` — Terminal integration-acceptance run (cross-slice end-to-end gate)](./plan_topics/H7a-integration-acceptance.md)

---

## MVP phase

The smallest end-to-end `.loom` that runs as a Pi slash command. One narrow vertical, end-to-end, to prove the pipeline before slice work begins.

- [`M-T` — Minimal end-to-end `.loom` slash command (tests)](./plan_topics/M-T-minimal-slash-command.md)
- [`M` — Minimal end-to-end `.loom` slash command](./plan_topics/M-minimal-slash-command.md)

---

## Vertical slices

Each slice is a coherent feature area (e.g. lexer, expressions, schemas, queries). Each leaf inside a slice is the smallest feature that can ship and be tested independently; slice grouping is editorial only. Leaves carry IDs like `V4b`. Slice numbering is an editorial grouping that only roughly tracks the dependency DAG (see `conventions.md` §3) — it is not a topological order. The canonical build order is dep-driven: pick the next leaf whose **Deps** are satisfied (How-to-use step 3), not the next slice number. Backward and non-linear cross-slice dependencies are expected; each is declared in the relevant leaf's **Deps** field. Each feature below is a paired `<id>-T` tests task and `<id>` implementation task; only the implementation leaf is linked, and its page lists its `-T` partner in **Deps**.

### V9 — Extension host integration

> **Interleave note.** V9 and V11 are not built as contiguous blocks. `V11a` (Binder-model resolution) depends on `V9b` and is itself a prerequisite of `V9c`/`V9i`/`V9j`, so the seam runs `V9b → V11a → V9c`/`V9i`/`V9j` — `V11a` lands mid-V9, not after all of V9. Separately, `V9h` (and therefore `V9g`) depend on `V18c` — the lightweight static-gates leaf from the `V18` SDK-gate slice (itself needing only `V18a`/`V18b`) — solely for its `session-shutdown-reason-snapshot` brand-string constant; they do **not** wait on the high-dependency runtime-evidence acceptance leaf `V18d`. Sequence by **Deps**, not slice number.

### V11 — Binder

> **Interleave note.** `V11a` depends on `V9b` and is a prerequisite of `V9c`/`V9i`/`V9j`, so it lands mid-V9 (seam `V9b → V11a → V9c`/`V9i`/`V9j`) rather than after the whole V9 slice. Sequence by **Deps**, not slice number.

## Release gate

This section is an editorial sub-grouping of the Horizontal phases above, not a fourth phase category: the release-gate leaves (`H5b`, `H6a`) are horizontal leaves in every respect — they cite a **Convention.** field and carry the `H<n><letter>` ID form — gathered here only because they run at release time.

A warn-only live-corpus canary ([`H5b`](./plan_topics/H5b-warn-only-canary.md)) runs the [`H5a`](./plan_topics/H5a-closing-gate-automation.md) closing gate over the live corpus without reddening CI, immediately before the terminal step ([`H6a`](./plan_topics/H6a-live-corpus-activation.md)) flips that gate from its seeded-fixture footing to its live-corpus footing. The canary's **Deps** name the complete coverage-producing set and carry the single statement of the transitive-completeness obligation; `H6a` sequences immediately after the canary (its **Deps** name `H5b`) and activates the loom 1.0 release gate referenced in item 5 above and in [`coverage-matrix.md`](./plan_topics/coverage-matrix.md). Reverting the `H6a` activation commit returns the gate to its `H5a` seeded-fixture footing.
