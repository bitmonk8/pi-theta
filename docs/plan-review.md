# T01 — "Sequential by default" omits the CLAUDE.md "Never block the async runtime" obligation

**Original heading:** "Sequential by default" omits CLAUDE.md "Never block the async runtime"
**Original section:** docs/plan_topics/conventions.md
**Kind:** doc-alignment-broad
**Importance:** medium
**Score:** 20
**MustFix:** false

## Finding

The project-level CLAUDE.md concurrency directive has two halves: *"Sequential by default"* and *"Never block the async runtime."* `conventions.md` adopts the first half verbatim as a cross-cutting rule, but that rule is scoped entirely to Promise-combinator concurrency — it forbids `Promise.all` / `Promise.race` / `Promise.allSettled` / `Promise.any` in `src/**` and defines the allow-list / closing-gate predicate for them. Nowhere in the plan corpus is the complementary half stated: synchronous blocking of the event loop (`fs.readFileSync`, `execSync`, busy-wait loops) is neither banned nor mentioned. A `grep` of the entire plan corpus for `readFileSync`, `execSync`, `busy-wait`, and `block`/`blocking` returns no hits.

This matters because the loom interpreter runs as plain async TypeScript on Pi's shared event loop (`spec_topics/implementation-notes.md` — "non-blocking at the runtime level, sequential at the language level"; "The loom interpreter runs as plain async TypeScript on Pi's event loop"). A synchronous blocking call in `src/**` would stall the host event loop for every concurrent invocation, which is exactly the failure the CLAUDE.md "Never block the async runtime" directive guards against — yet an implementer reading only the plan's "Sequential by default" rule sees only the Promise-combinator ban and has no documentary surface reminding them of the blocking-call prohibition.

The omission is also an enforcement-posture gap: the `no-restricted-syntax` lint wired by `H2a` matches only the four Promise-combinator forms. Blocking synchronous calls are not lint-detectable by that rule, so the blocking-runtime ban — even once stated — would carry no mechanical gate and would rest on the seam-adapter discipline (I/O routed through the `V8*` FileSystem seam) plus the Per-phase TDD ritual self-review step. The plan should state both the obligation and that it is unenforced mechanically.

## Plan Documents

- `docs/plan_topics/conventions.md` — *Sequential by default* cross-cutting rule; *Per-phase TDD ritual* self-review step (edited)
- `docs/plan_topics/H2a-cross-cutting-gates.md` — Convention / Tests bullet for *Sequential by default* (read-only) — confirms the `no-restricted-syntax` lint scope is Promise-combinators only

## Spec Documents

None

(`spec_topics/implementation-notes.md` grounds the "runs on Pi's event loop / non-blocking at the runtime level" property the fix cites, but the fix is internal to the plan and edits no spec page.)

## Affected Leaves

**Phases:** None

**Leaves (implementation order):**

None

(Cross-cutting `conventions.md` doc-alignment fix. `H2a`'s lint scope is unchanged — the blocking-call ban is explicitly non-lint-detectable — so no leaf's acceptance criteria, Deps, or sequencing change.)

## Consequence

**Severity:** advisory

An implementer following only the plan corpus has no statement of the blocking-runtime prohibition; a `fs.readFileSync` / `execSync` / busy-wait in `src/**` would stall Pi's shared event loop for all concurrent invocations, and neither the `no-restricted-syntax` lint nor any closing-gate check would catch it. Implementers can still produce working leaves (the seam-adapter discipline routes I/O off the blocking path), so this is a guidance gap rather than a hard blocker.

## Issue introduction

**Verdict:** present-since-inception
**Introducing commits:** `288f191` (2026-05-04) — "Add implementation plan with horizontal/MVP/vertical-slice phases"
**History:** The *Sequential by default* rule entered the corpus in `288f191` (then in the single-file `plan.md`) scoped to Promise-combinators only, and carried unchanged through the per-topic split (`fecb504`) into `conventions.md` and the `docs/` move (`31ff060`). `git log -S "Never block the async"`, `git log -S "readFileSync" -- docs/`, and `git log -S "execSync" -- docs/` show the blocking-runtime ban has never appeared in the plan corpus. The gap is original to the rule's authoring, not introduced by a later edit.

## Solution Space

**Shape:** single

### Recommendation

Append to the *Sequential by default* cross-cutting rule in `docs/plan_topics/conventions.md` text stating that the rule subsumes the CLAUDE.md *"Never block the async runtime"* directive: synchronous blocking of the event loop in `src/**` (e.g. `fs.readFileSync`, `execSync`, busy-wait loops) is forbidden because the interpreter runs on Pi's shared event loop (cross-reference `spec_topics/implementation-notes.md`). State the enforcement posture explicitly: this half carries **no mechanical gate** — the `no-restricted-syntax` rule wired by `H2a` matches only the Promise-combinator forms — so the blocking-call ban is enforced by the seam-adapter discipline (file/process I/O routed through the `V8*` FileSystem seam) and the *Per-phase TDD ritual* self-review step.

Add a blocking-call check to the self-review enumeration in the *Per-phase TDD ritual* (the bullet that already enumerates the broad-catch, globals, and ambient-primitive checks), so the manual residue this ban concedes has a named review home — mirroring how the *No globals* and ambient-access rules route their non-mechanical residue to the same self-review step.

# T02 — `DISC-4` is split across two coverage-matrix rows instead of the canonical multi-close form

**Original heading:** `DISC-4` appears in two rows, differentiated only by paraphrase qualifiers
**Original section:** docs/plan_topics/coverage-matrix.md
**Kind:** traceability
**Importance:** medium
**Score:** 25
**MustFix:** false

## Finding

In `coverage-matrix.md`'s *Numbered REQ-IDs* table, the single executable REQ-ID `DISC-4` is mapped by two separate rows:

```
| DISC-4 (discovery/collision detection) | `V10a` |
| DISC-4 (superseded-entry dispatch)     | `V9b`  |
```

`DISC-4` is one REQ-ID (`spec_topics/discovery/discovery-sources.md` §DISC-4, "Slash-name collision rules"); `V10a` closes its discovery/collision-detection aspect and `V9b` closes the `LoomRegistry`-side superseded-entry-dispatch aspect (`spec_topics/pi-integration-contract/drain-state-contract.md` §superseded-entry-dispatch, which cites DISC-4). Both closures are correct.

Every other multi-leaf REQ-ID in the same table uses one row with a comma-separated leaf cell — `ERR-17 | V4d, V13d`, `ERR-19 | V4d, V13c`, `CIO-1 | V16a, V4e, V11f`, `CIO-5 | V16a, H7a`, `DIAG-4 | V7b, V7c`, `CNCL-4 | V17a, V9g`. `DISC-4` is the lone deviation: it carries two rows whose REQ-ID column holds free-text parenthetical qualifiers (`(discovery/collision detection)`, `(superseded-entry dispatch)`) that appear on no other row and are not part of the column's machine-readable `PREFIX-N` token contract. A REQ-ID extractor or closing-gate scan that builds a `Map<REQ-ID, leaves>` keyed on the bare token sees `DISC-4` twice; depending on implementation it either drops one closer (second row overwrites first) or fails to parse the qualified left cell, so two reasonable gate implementations diverge on whether `DISC-4` maps to `{V10a}`, `{V9b}`, or both.

## Plan Documents

- `docs/plan_topics/coverage-matrix.md` — *Numbered REQ-IDs (runtime obligations)* table (edited)
- `docs/plan_topics/conventions.md` — §Leaf format (Deps note) / §REQ-ID discipline — defines the REQ-ID→closing-leaf mapping contract (read-only)
- `docs/plan_topics/V10a-discovery-walk.md` — DISC-4 collision-detection closure (read-only)
- `docs/plan_topics/V9b-registration-drain-state.md` — DISC-4 superseded-entry-dispatch closure (read-only)

- `docs/plan_topics/H5a-closing-gate-automation.md` — transitive-completeness reconciliation arm (read-only)

## Spec Documents

None — the fix is purely internal to plan files; both DISC-4 aspects already trace to existing spec anchors (`discovery-sources.md` §DISC-4, `drain-state-contract.md` §superseded-entry-dispatch).

## Affected Leaves

**Phases:** None

**Leaves (implementation order):**

None — the fix edits only `coverage-matrix.md`. `V10a` and `V9b` remain DISC-4's closing leaves with no change to their acceptance criteria; the finding lives in a cross-cutting plan file and does not propagate into any leaf file.

## Consequence

**Severity:** correctness

A tool or closing-gate scan that keys DISC-4's closing set on the bare REQ-ID token can silently drop one of the two closers (`V10a` or `V9b`) or fail to parse the qualified left cell, so the matrix no longer reliably records that DISC-4 has two distinct closers. A reviewer enumerating live REQ-IDs from the table double-counts DISC-4. Both manifest as a traceability/closure-coverage divergence rather than a hard build break.

## Issue introduction

**Verdict:** single-commit-introduction
**Introducing commits:** `9d61b210479fa7103ae2ab39e31580dd005f902d` (2026-06-11 20:44:09 +0200)
**History:** The plan corpus is git-tracked. `git log -S 'superseded-entry dispatch' -- docs/plan_topics/coverage-matrix.md` and `git show 9d61b21 -- docs/plan_topics/coverage-matrix.md` show DISC-4 was a single row `DISC-1, DISC-2, DISC-3, DISC-4 | V10a` until commit `9d61b21` ("resolve 'DISC-4 superseded-dispatch assertion belongs on V9b not V10a'"). That fix correctly added `V9b` as the superseded-entry-dispatch closer but expressed the two closers as two parenthetically-qualified rows instead of the canonical comma-separated multi-close form, introducing the deviation. No earlier revision contains the two-row form.

## Solution Space

**Shape:** single

### Recommendation

In `coverage-matrix.md`'s *Numbered REQ-IDs* table, replace the two `DISC-4` rows with a single row whose REQ-ID column holds the bare token `DISC-4` and whose leaf cell lists both closers comma-separated, matching the established multi-close form used by `ERR-17`, `CIO-1`, `DIAG-4`, etc. The per-leaf aspect labels may ride as parenthetical qualifiers on each leaf inside the leaf cell so the distinct closures stay legible — for example:

```
| DISC-4 | `V10a` (collision-detection closure), `V9b` (superseded-entry-dispatch closure) |
```

Place the consolidated row where `DISC-4` sorts (immediately after the `DISC-1, DISC-2, DISC-3 | V10a` row). Leave `DISC-1, DISC-2, DISC-3 | V10a` unchanged.

Implementer edge case: under the consolidated single row, `H5a`'s transitive-completeness arm treats `DISC-4` as a multi-leaf cell that stays green when only one listed leaf is in `H5b`'s `Deps.` (the primary/co-witness rule). Both `V10a` and `V9b` genuinely close distinct DISC-4 aspects, so confirm both remain present in `H5b`'s `Deps.` (they are today, via the `V10a`–`V10c` and `V9a`–`V9j` ranges) so neither aspect's closure can be dropped without the gate firing.

## Relationships

- T03 "`diagnostic-emission-isolation.md` and `session-shutdown-semantics.md` are closed by `V9g` but absent from the coverage-matrix code-keyed table" — same-cluster (same `coverage-matrix.md` traceability surface; resolves independently)
