# Findings parked from `spec-review.md` — pi-loom

_This file collects findings physically removed from the
consolidated spec-review document because they cannot be addressed
by the current `/fix-spec-shape-single-findings` pipeline. Each
entry records the reason for parking and the path to the per-finding
forensic report. Parked findings must be reshaped (typically by
splitting bimodal obligations, narrowing scope, demoting MUSTs,
or capping the prose the fix is allowed to add) before being
re-introduced into the live review document._

_Cascade-parked findings (parked solely because they depended on
another parked finding) typically un-park automatically once the
upstream finding's reshape is re-introduced and successfully fixed,
unless they have substantive shape problems of their own._

## T18a — Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel

> **PARKED** — 2026-05-17
> **Reason:** The inner spec-diff-fix-loop's severity-weighted triage exited on must-fix-blocked-by-scope-guard (plan §Change A clause 1 escape): a raised lens finding outranked this originating finding in importance, but every viable remediation would violate a class-1 or class-2 scope guard forwarded from the top-level fixer. FIXCOUNTS: none. Loop notes: Classifier exited score-budget-exhausted on the rewound pass-1 re-run; S=25, Σ=30, breach margin=5. Pre-rewind original pass-1 produced 2 fixes → pass-2 fan-out raised 10 fix-class findings tripping C2 surface-expansion detector. Backtracked, poisoned both pass-1 fixes; re-run pass-1 surfaced a high/must-fix=true consistency blocker (F3 — handler-frame contradiction between PIC and slash-invocation.md L18) plus two trust-override consistency fixes (F3, F4), two poisoned defers (F1, F2), one cheap-fix (F7), and two budget-breaching completeness findings (F5, F6). The originating T18a S=25 is too tight to absorb the persistence-domain ambiguity and the pre-evaluation-no-terminal-outcome carve-out gap; reshape (split, raise S, or pre-decide the persistence-domain quantifier and pre-start-teardown rule) before re-running. The surfaced consistency blocker (PIC vs. slash-invocation.md) is the higher-priority shape concern; if T18b/c/d are reshaped together, fold that contradiction in. A human must resolve the guard-vs-severity collision (relax the guard, split this finding so the higher-importance raised finding is no longer downstream of the guard, or accept the trade-off and annotate the raised finding as out-of-scope) before re-introducing this finding.

# T18a — Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel

**Kind:** completeness
**Importance:** medium
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The **Runtime event channel** section in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` enumerates the **always-log set** of failure outcomes that emit on the `loom-system-note` channel — including the explicit four-excluded-kinds paragraph (`validation`, `context_overflow`, `cancelled`, `invoke_callee_error`) — but never makes the symmetric statement on the success side: that a loom terminating with `Ok(v)`, including a child loom whose `Ok` flows to its `invoke` parent, emits no event on that channel. Reviewers must triangulate against `docs/spec_topics/invocation.md` and the per-mode bullets in `docs/spec_topics/slash-invocation.md` to confirm the success-visible surfaces are programmatic-only, and the sibling per-surface restatements (T18b in `slash-invocation.md`, T18c in `spec.md`) and the V18q test clause (T18d) have no central spec sentence to anchor against.

## Solution approach

Add a success-side null-policy statement to the **Runtime event channel** section in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` asserting that a loom terminating with `Ok(v)` — including the case where a child loom's `Ok` flows to its `invoke` parent — emits no event on the `loom-system-note` channel. Name the success-visible surfaces (the driven conversation in prompt mode and the programmatic return value in every mode).

## Solution constraints

- Scope the null-policy to the *terminal* outcome surface only; do not extend it to pre-evaluation surfaces (the binder echo on `bind_echo: true` and the no-params overflow note remain operator-visible regardless of terminal outcome).
- Do not add a "completed" parity note for subagent slash invocations — that re-opens the deferred aggregation / latency surface intentionally scoped out of V1.
- The per-mode operator-side null sentences in `slash-invocation.md`, the `spec.md` **Runtime observability** aggregator forward-link, and the V18q test clause are owned by T18b, T18c, and T18d respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code, a new always-log `kind`, or a new `customType` value; the edit is one additive paragraph inside the existing section.

## Relationships

- T18b "Add per-mode operator-side null sentences to slash-invocation.md" — must-precede (the central PIC paragraph must land before the slash-invocation restatement points at it).
- T18c "Widen spec.md Runtime observability bullet to forward-link the null-policy" — must-precede (the bullet's forward-link target must exist).
- T18d "Add V18q test asserting zero `loom-system-note` emissions on successful termination" — must-precede (the test asserts against the spec sentence installed here).
- T19a "Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId" — same-cluster (operator-surface gap on the failure side; symmetric to this child's success-side gap; co-resolve siblings T19b/c/d/e also relevant).
- T06 "Operator role: TUI binding asserted in glossary but never reconciled with non-interactive callers" — same-cluster.

## T18d — Add V18q test asserting zero `loom-system-note` emissions on successful termination

> **PARKED** — 2026-05-17
> **Reason:** Cascaded from parking of T18a — Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel: this finding's ## Relationships block declares an ordering edge (must-precede or must-follow) on the parked finding, so its preconditions are no longer satisfied in spec-review.md.

# T18d — Add V18q test asserting zero `loom-system-note` emissions on successful termination

**Kind:** completeness
**Importance:** medium
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The V18q **Tests.** bullet under `## V18q — Runtime event channel and always-log emission` in `docs/plan_topics/v18-cancellation.md` asserts via clause (b) that the four excluded `kind`s (`validation`, `context_overflow`, `cancelled`, `invoke_callee_error`) emit zero `loom-system-note` events on the always-log channel, but contains no symmetric clause asserting the success-side null: that a loom terminating with `Ok(v)` emits zero `loom-system-note` events on that channel. Sibling T18a installs the central success-side null-policy paragraph in PIC Runtime event channel; without a paired test clause in V18q, the leaf's **Ships when.** condition cannot catch a regression of that rule, and two compliant implementations could ship divergent success-side emission behaviour.

## Solution approach

Add one new lettered clause to the V18q **Tests.** bullet in `docs/plan_topics/v18-cancellation.md` asserting that a successful prompt-mode loom and a successful slash-invoked subagent-mode loom each emit zero `loom-system-note` events on the always-log channel. Mirror clause (b)'s structural shape (one clause covering both scenarios inline). The clause asserts against the success-side null-policy that sibling T18a installs centrally in PIC Runtime event channel; do not author the spec-side rule here.

## Solution constraints

- Append to V18q's **Tests.** bullet using the next free letter; do not renumber, drop, reword, or reorder existing clauses (a) through (l). In particular, do not weaken clause (b)'s four-excluded-kinds enumeration — the success-side null is additive to those guarantees, not a substitute.
- Do not edit V18q's **Spec.**, **Adds.**, **Deps.**, or **Ships when.** lines, and do not introduce a new diagnostic code, always-log `kind`, `customType`, or cross-leaf dependency change.

## Relationships

- T18a "Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel" — must-follow.
- T18b "Add per-mode operator-side null sentences to slash-invocation.md" — co-resolve.
- T18c "Widen spec.md Runtime observability bullet to forward-link the null-policy" — co-resolve.

## T18c — Widen spec.md Runtime observability bullet to forward-link the null-policy

> **PARKED** — 2026-05-17
> **Reason:** Cascaded from parking of T18a — Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel: this finding's ## Relationships block declares an ordering edge (must-precede or must-follow) on the parked finding, so its preconditions are no longer satisfied in spec-review.md.

# T18c — Widen spec.md Runtime observability bullet to forward-link the null-policy

**Kind:** completeness
**Importance:** medium
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The **Runtime observability** bullet under `### Scope` in `docs/spec.md` (Orientation > Scope) describes only failure-side events on the `loom-system-note` channel and neither names nor forward-links the success-side null-policy — that a loom terminating with `Ok(v)` emits no `loom-system-note` event. Reviewers auditing the operator-visibility contract from this aggregator bullet must triangulate against the PIC **Runtime event channel** section and `docs/spec_topics/slash-invocation.md` to confirm the absence of a success-side emission is deliberate. Sibling T18a installs the central success-side null-policy paragraph in the PIC **Runtime event channel** section and T18b installs the per-mode operator-side null sentences in `slash-invocation.md`, but the spec.md aggregator bullet still gives no forward link to either, so the rule cannot be reached from the canonical entry surface.

## Solution approach

Widen the **Runtime observability** bullet under `### Scope` in `docs/spec.md` by adding a clarifying sentence that names the success-side null-policy on the `loom-system-note` channel and forward-links both the PIC **Runtime event channel** section in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` (the central success-side null-policy owner) and the **Once a loom is invoked** section in `docs/spec_topics/slash-invocation.md` (the per-mode operator-surface owner). Do not author the rule itself in `spec.md` — characterise the policy in one short sentence and rely on the link targets that siblings T18a and T18b install for the normative content. Preserve the bullet's existing failure-side framing and existing forward-links unchanged.

## Solution constraints

- Preserve every existing forward-link in the bullet (Glossary; PIC Runtime event channel; Diagnostics; Future Considerations — Richer runtime-event telemetry) — link text and targets unchanged.
- Preserve the bullet's existing failure-side framing (the *always-log set* Operator-facing runtime-failure framing, the disjoint `details`-shape sentence, the deferred-aggregation sentence) unchanged in normative content.
- The widening must name both forward-link targets (PIC **Runtime event channel** as the central owner, AND `slash-invocation.md` as the per-mode operator-surface owner); do not collapse to one link.
- The central success-side null-policy paragraph (T18a), the per-mode operator-side null sentences (T18b), and the V18q test clause (T18d) are owned elsewhere.

## Relationships

- T18a "Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel" — must-follow.
- T18b "Add per-mode operator-side null sentences to slash-invocation.md" — co-resolve.
- T18d "Add V18q test asserting zero `loom-system-note` emissions on successful termination" — co-resolve.

## T18b — Add per-mode operator-side null sentences to slash-invocation.md

> **PARKED** — 2026-05-17
> **Reason:** Cascaded from parking of T18a — Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel: this finding's ## Relationships block declares an ordering edge (must-precede or must-follow) on the parked finding, so its preconditions are no longer satisfied in spec-review.md.

# T18b — Add per-mode operator-side null sentences to slash-invocation.md

**Kind:** completeness
**Importance:** medium
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The **prompt mode** and **subagent mode** bullets under *Once a loom is invoked* in `docs/spec_topics/slash-invocation.md` describe the per-mode invocation and conversation-driving surfaces but neither bullet states the operator-side success-outcome null — that a successfully terminating loom emits no `loom-system-note` and that the operator-visible surfaces on success are the per-mode conversation / programmatic-return-value pair only. Sibling T18a installs the central success-side null-policy paragraph in the PIC **Runtime event channel** section, but a reader of `slash-invocation.md` must triangulate against PIC and `docs/spec_topics/invocation.md` to confirm the absence of a terminal operator-side note is deliberate rather than an under-specified surface.

## Solution approach

Add one per-surface null sentence to each of the **prompt mode** and **subagent mode** bullets under *Once a loom is invoked* in `docs/spec_topics/slash-invocation.md`. Each sentence restates, at the per-mode operator-surface level, the success-side null-policy that T18a installs centrally in the PIC **Runtime event channel** section: the prompt-mode sentence names `loom-system-note` and asserts no such note is emitted on successful termination, identifying the driven conversation as the operator-visible surface; the subagent-mode sentence asserts that the operator sees no terminal note on success (the subagent transcript is private and the return value reaches only the programmatic caller) and identifies the pre-start binder echo and the failure-side top-level `Err` note as the operator-visible surfaces. Do not author the central rule — restate the per-mode consequence and rely on T18a's PIC paragraph for the normative source.

## Solution constraints

- Do not modify the pre-existing per-mode framing in either bullet (the prompt-mode current-conversation-driving description and `Ok`-return-value-not-surfaced-to-user clause; the subagent-mode fresh-isolated-conversation description and return-value-only-reaches-caller clause).
- The central success-side null-policy paragraph (T18a), the `spec.md` aggregator forward-link (T18c), and the V18q test clause (T18d) are owned elsewhere — out of scope here.

## Relationships

- T18a "Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel" — must-follow (the central rule must land first).
- T18c "Widen spec.md Runtime observability bullet to forward-link the null-policy" — co-resolve (sibling per-surface restatement; same edit pass).
- T18d "Add V18q test asserting zero `loom-system-note` emissions on successful termination" — co-resolve.

## T16b — Rewrite callable-set paragraph: drop inline `customTools` / `createAgentSession` / `pi.setActiveTools` names

> **PARKED** — 2026-05-18
> **Reason:** The inner spec-diff-fix-loop diverged: the most recent pass produced more fix-class findings than the previous one. FIXCOUNTS: 4,1,0,1,0,4,1,1,4. Loop notes: Diverged at pass 9 (fixCount jumped 1→4 outside stage-boundary). Pass 8 SP-2 mode (d) reverted docs/spec.md#scope to baseline-post-top-level; that revert plus PIC subagent visibility-pin sentence re-exposed latent concerns, raising 4 fix-class on pass 9 that were discarded. Bimodal recommendation (mechanism-vs-effect framing); a human should split it.

# T16b — Rewrite callable-set paragraph: drop inline `customTools` / `createAgentSession` / `pi.setActiveTools` names

**Kind:** placement
**Importance:** medium
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The callable-set paragraph in the Trust-boundary bullet under Orientation > Scope in `docs/spec.md` names packaging-level Pi-API identifiers — the `customTools` array on `createAgentSession` for subagent mode and the `pi.setActiveTools` snapshot/restore pair for prompt mode — to characterise how the per-mode callable-set wiring is enforced. Those identifiers are owned verbatim by the **Tool-registration lifetime and visibility** and **Conversation drive — subagent mode** sections of `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`; the aggregator restatement drifts the moment either Pi API surface is renamed, replaced, or restructured. The behavioural property the trust-boundary scope decision actually rests on is the per-mode wiring isolation, not the specific Pi APIs that implement it.

## Solution approach

Rewrite the callable-set paragraph in the Trust-boundary bullet so it states only the behavioural isolation rule — subagent-mode invocations see only the loom's declared callable set; prompt-mode invocations see the loom's declared callable set unioned with the user session's snapshot for the swap window — and forward-links the **Tool-registration lifetime and visibility** section in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` for the SDK-call mechanism. Drop the inline `customTools`, `createAgentSession`, and `pi.setActiveTools` identifiers from the paragraph. The SDK-call mechanism remains owned by the linked PIC section.

## Solution constraints

- Do not inline the Pi-API identifiers `customTools`, `createAgentSession`, or `pi.setActiveTools` (or any other Pi-API symbol that names how callables are wired for either mode); those are owned by **Tool-registration lifetime and visibility** in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`.
- Preserve the *callable set* clarification — that the loom's declared callable set is a configuration knob over the *model's* reachable callable set, NOT a host-process sandbox — and its forward-link to [Parameters and Frontmatter — `tools`](./spec_topics/frontmatter.md#tools).
- The host-side-denial paragraph and the closing capability-model sentence are owned by T16c and T16d respectively — leave them untouched here.

## Relationships

- T16a "Reduce Trust-boundary SDK-surface clause: drop the `~0.72.1` literal" — co-resolve.
- T16c "Reduce host-side-denial paragraph to one sentence with forward-links" — co-resolve.
- T16d "Replace closing capability-model paragraph with single forward-link sentence" — co-resolve.

## T16a — Reduce Trust-boundary SDK-surface clause: drop the `~0.72.1` literal

> **PARKED** — 2026-05-18
> **Reason:** The inner spec-diff-fix-loop diverged: the most recent pass produced more fix-class findings than the previous one. FIXCOUNTS: 2,2,2,2,3. Loop notes: Loop diverged at pass 5 after four flat passes (2→3 fix-count). Trust-boundary bullet cycled through whack-a-mole shapes; scope guard forbids re-inlining SDK pin literal; PIC Host prerequisites doesn't own privilege claim. Reshape: split T16a from surviving-prose backing concern, or move privilege-absence claim to a PIC subsection that owns it before deleting inline backing.

# T16a — Reduce Trust-boundary SDK-surface clause: drop the `~0.72.1` literal

**Kind:** placement
**Importance:** medium
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The SDK-surface clause of the Trust-boundary bullet under Orientation > Scope in `docs/spec.md` inlines the literal Pi-SDK pin `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent ~0.72.1` while restating that Pi's `ExtensionAPI` and `ExtensionContext` surfaces expose no per-extension privilege facet. That literal pin is owned verbatim by **Host prerequisites — Pi SDK pin** in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`; restating it inside the Trust-boundary bullet creates a second site that the **Pi version bump procedure** in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` (anchor `id="pi-version-bump-procedure"`) expects to drift on the next bump. The behavioural property the scope decision actually rests on is the no-per-extension-privilege-facet property at the V1 Pi-SDK pin, not the literal version range.

## Solution approach

Rewrite the SDK-surface clause of the Trust-boundary bullet so it states only the behavioural property — that the peer packages expose no per-extension privilege facet at the V1 Pi-SDK pin — and forward-links **Host prerequisites — Pi SDK pin** in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` in lieu of restating the pin. Drop the inline `~0.72.1` parenthetical entirely. Retain the build-time SDK surface-inventory assertion as a single sentence carrying its forward-link to the anchor `id="pi-version-bump-procedure"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`.

## Solution constraints

- Do not inline the literal `~0.72.1` (or any structural variant restating the Pi SDK pin); that pin remains owned solely by **Host prerequisites — Pi SDK pin** in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`.
- The callable-set paragraph, the host-side-denial paragraph, and the closing capability-model sentence are owned by T16b, T16c, and T16d respectively — leave them present and untouched here.

## Relationships

- T16b "Rewrite callable-set paragraph: drop inline `customTools` / `createAgentSession` / `pi.setActiveTools` names" — co-resolve (same Trust-boundary bullet; must land in one commit).
- T16c "Reduce host-side-denial paragraph to one sentence with forward-links" — co-resolve.
- T16d "Replace closing capability-model paragraph with single forward-link sentence" — co-resolve.
- T34 "Trust-boundary 'no privilege facet' claim is asserted but not gated by any audit the spec cites" — same-cluster (same bullet; orthogonal fix — adds an audit citation rather than restructures placement).
- T15a "Reduce Session-model Orientation paragraph to a four-sentence forward-linking bullet" — same-cluster (the Session-model paragraph exhibits the same aggregator-overreach pattern).

## T15a — Reduce Session-model Orientation paragraph to a four-sentence forward-linking bullet

> **PARKED** — 2026-05-18T03:38:23Z
> **Reason:** The top-level spec-review-fixer refused to apply the recommended resolution. Refusal reason: defer: precondition not met. T15a's Solution constraint requires T15b to land first (so the `Concurrency model` subsection exists as the relocation destination). T15c has landed but T15b is still pending in docs/spec-review.md and no `Concurrency model` subsection exists. Deferred without editing per the finding's explicit defer instruction.
> **Forensic report:** .pi/tmp/spec-fix-failure-forensics/2026-05-17T16-41-31_b4324e/t15a-reduce-session-model-orientation-paragraph-to-a-four-sentence-forward-linki.md

# T15a — Reduce Session-model Orientation paragraph to a four-sentence forward-linking bullet

**Kind:** placement
**Importance:** medium
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `<a id="session-model"></a>` paragraph in `docs/spec.md` Orientation > Prerequisites compresses five distinct content categories — Pi-session binding, `session_shutdown` payload contract, prompt-mode sequentiality argument with its three supporting premises, mode-qualified transcript/tool-table isolation, and admission-cap / per-invocation-budget posture — into one Orientation bullet. The architectural clauses belong in the new `Concurrency model` subsection owned by T15b, and the V1 scope deferrals (parallel-`invoke`, concurrent user sessions) belong at the V1 non-goals surfaces owned by T15c; until this reduction lands, those siblings have no room to relocate content into. The paragraph reads as a single mixed block rather than as Orientation-level forward-linking prose.

## Solution approach

Reduce the `<a id="session-model"></a>` paragraph in `docs/spec.md` Orientation > Prerequisites to orientation-level forward-link prose. The retained content categories are: the one-session-at-a-time Pi-session binding (forward-link to the Session-binding contract in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`), the `session_shutdown` payload contract (forward-link to the Extension entry point in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` and to the closed `event.reason` set in the SDK type at `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`'s `dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts`), and a pointer to the architectural `Concurrency model` subsection installed by T15b. Delete the clauses T15b relocated (mode-qualified isolation summary, prompt-mode sequentiality with premises (i)/(ii)/(iii), genuine-concurrency-only-between-subagent-invocations conclusion, cancellation-propagates-downward restatement, per-invocation budget scoping, no-admission-cap statement) and the deferrals T15c lifted (parallel-`invoke`, concurrent user sessions). Composition — sentence count, ordering of forward-links, whether closely-related pointers fold into one sentence — is the implementer's choice.

## Solution constraints

- The reduced paragraph must retain the `<a id="session-model"></a>` anchor — inbound links (the Overview's terminal-outcomes paragraph, the `[Session model](#session-model)` reference inside the V1 non-goals subsection) depend on it.
- The destination `Concurrency model` subsection is owned by T15b — do not author it under this finding.
- T15b and T15c MUST have already landed before this finding is addressed (bottom-up ordering guarantees this: T15c at the highest line number is addressed first, T15b second, this finding T15a last). If either the `Concurrency model` subsection installed by T15b or the V1 non-goals entries verified by T15c is absent at edit time, defer.

## Relationships

- T15b "Move concurrency semantics into Extension Architecture / Implementation Notes Concurrency-model subsection" — co-resolve (the reduction makes room for the relocated content).
- T15c "Lift Session-model scope deferrals into Non-goals (V1) section" — co-resolve (the reduction makes room for the lifted deferrals).
- T02 "Subagent state-isolation enumeration duplicates PIC matrix in Overview opening paragraph" — same-cluster (identical placement pattern).
- T16a "Trust boundary bullet: keep scope claim and drop SDK-pin literal" — same-cluster (sibling Scope bullet exhibiting the same mixing of categories).
- T18a "Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel" — same-cluster (third instance of the pattern, in the Runtime-observability bullet).
- T24 "Fork-reason watcher closure leaves the extension in an unspecified, silently degraded state" — same-cluster (touches the same Session-model paragraph but addresses content correctness).

## T14 — Prompt-mode sequentiality argument has an unstated fourth premise

> **Reason:** The inner spec-diff-fix-loop's severity-weighted triage exited on must-fix-blocked-by-scope-guard (plan §Change A clause 1 escape): a raised lens finding outranked this originating finding in importance, but every viable remediation would violate a class-1 or class-2 scope guard forwarded from the top-level fixer. FIXCOUNTS: 2,2. Loop notes: must-fix-blocked-by-scope-guard. Pass-3 classifier merged six lens findings into one must-fix:true high (clause iv cites a "further rule" that doesn't exist in invocation.md Cross-mode semantics). Three remediation paths blocked by ScopeGuards 1 or 2 or matrix-coverage break. T14 likely needs reshape — either retire (subagent→prompt already discharged elsewhere) or land T15a/b/c paragraph restructure first. A human must resolve the guard-vs-severity collision (relax the guard, split this finding so the higher-importance raised finding is no longer downstream of the guard, or accept the trade-off and annotate the raised finding as out-of-scope) before re-introducing this finding.

# T14 — Prompt-mode sequentiality argument has an unstated fourth premise

**Kind:** assumptions
**Importance:** medium
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The Session-model paragraph in `docs/spec.md` (anchored at `id="session-model"`) concludes that prompt-mode bodies execute strictly sequentially within a user session and supports that conclusion with three premises (i)/(ii)/(iii) that only close the user-session axis. Those three premises do not on their own rule out the sibling-subagent fan-out path that the next paragraph explicitly admits: a subagent-mode body may itself `invoke(...)` a prompt-mode child, and whether such a child can re-enter the user session and contend for `pi.setActiveTools` is the load-bearing question. The closing rule lives in the Cross-mode semantics section of `docs/spec_topics/invocation.md` (a `subagent → prompt` callee attaches to the subagent's own private `AgentSession`, not the user session), but a reader auditing the argument from `spec.md` alone cannot derive that — the fourth premise is unstated.

## Solution approach

Add a fourth premise to the parenthesised support list in the Session-model paragraph that names the Cross-mode rule closing the subagent-spawned-prompt-mode-child escape, and forward-link to the owning section in `docs/spec_topics/invocation.md`. Cite the Cross-mode rule rather than inlining or paraphrasing it. Leave the existing three premises and the follow-up "three potential sources of in-session overlap" sentence unchanged.

## Solution constraints

- The new premise must forward-link the Cross-mode semantics section and must not inline, restate, or paraphrase its content beyond a one-clause framing of which fan-out path is closed — that is the whole point of the finding (avoid aggregator overreach).
- Do not modify the existing premises (i)/(ii)/(iii) or the follow-up "three potential sources of in-session overlap" sentence.
- Restructuring of the Session-model paragraph is owned by T15a / T15b / T15c; the fourth premise is carried across whichever sibling lands first per T15b's coordination with this finding.
- Plan-leaf edits to V15g / V15h / V15j are out of scope here.

## Relationships

- T23 "Pi's per-session slash-handler serialisation is asserted without a verifiable Pi source" — same-cluster (different premise of the same argument).
- T15a "Reduce Session-model Orientation paragraph to a four-sentence forward-linking bullet" — same-cluster (touches the same Session-model paragraph; co-edit pass).
- T19a "Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId" — same-cluster (also concerns the sibling-subagent fan-out path, on the diagnostics axis; co-resolve siblings T19b/c/d/e also relevant).
- T20 "Resource exhaustion under concurrent subagent invocations is undisclaimed for non-memory classes" — same-cluster (same fan-out path, resource-exhaustion axis).

## T15b — Move concurrency semantics into Extension Architecture / Implementation Notes Concurrency-model subsection

> **PARKED** — 2026-05-18
> **Reason:** Cascaded from parking of T14 — Prompt-mode sequentiality argument has an unstated fourth premise: this finding's ## Relationships block declares an ordering edge (must-precede or must-follow) on the parked finding, so its preconditions are no longer satisfied in spec-review.md.
> **Forensic report:** .pi/tmp/spec-fix-failure-forensics/2026-05-17T16-41-31_b4324e/t14-prompt-mode-sequentiality-argument-has-an-unstated-fourth-premise.md

# T15b — Move concurrency semantics into Extension Architecture / Implementation Notes Concurrency-model subsection

**Kind:** placement
**Importance:** medium
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The architectural half of the `<a id="session-model"></a>` paragraph in `docs/spec.md` Orientation > Prerequisites — the mode-qualified isolation summary, prompt-mode strict sequentiality with its three supporting premises (i)/(ii)/(iii), the genuine-concurrency-only-between-subagent-invocations conclusion, the cancellation-propagates-downward-only restatement, and per-invocation budget scoping — sits inside an Orientation bullet labelled informative rather than in a normative-architectural home. T15a's reduction of that paragraph removes those clauses from Orientation; with no destination in `## Extension Architecture` or `## Implementation Notes` they are dropped on the floor and the architectural reader has no aggregator to land on. The spec presently has no `Concurrency model` subsection under either home.

## Solution approach

Add a new `Concurrency model` subsection in `docs/spec.md` under `## Extension Architecture` as a sibling entry to Pi Extension Integration. **Copy** the listed architectural clauses into the new subsection as an aggregator analogous to the Hard-ceilings bullet, preserving each clause's existing forward-links to `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`, `docs/spec_topics/implementation-notes.md`, `docs/spec_topics/cancellation.md`, `docs/spec_topics/invocation.md`, and `docs/spec_topics/frontmatter.md` verbatim. The corresponding **removal** from the `<a id="session-model"></a>` paragraph is owned by T15a and is out of scope here — the addition (this finding) and the removal (T15a) land as two consecutive single-finding commits under bottom-up ordering, with a transient content duplication in HEAD between them by design.

## Solution constraints

- Do not place it under `## Implementation Notes`.
- Do not restate owner-page text beyond what the forward-links require.
- Preserve every forward-link from the listed clauses verbatim — same targets, same count — across the copy. This is a copy, not a rewrite.
- Preserve the three sequentiality premises (i)/(ii)/(iii) verbatim from the source paragraph; the fourth premise is owned by T14 and added in T14's edit pass, not here.
- Do NOT edit the `<a id="session-model"></a>` paragraph under this finding — removal of the now-duplicated clauses from the source paragraph is owned by T15a and lands in the immediately-following commit under bottom-up ordering. A transient content duplication between the new `Concurrency model` subsection and the still-untouched `<a id="session-model"></a>` paragraph is the **expected intermediate state** between this commit and T15a's commit.
- **Inner-loop guidance for the spec-diff fix loop on this commit:** the diff for this finding intentionally introduces content that duplicates the unchanged `<a id="session-model"></a>` paragraph in `docs/spec.md`. Findings of the form *"the new Concurrency model subsection duplicates the session-model paragraph"*, *"the same forward-link appears in two places"*, or *"premises (i)/(ii)/(iii) are stated twice"* are out of scope for the inner loop on this commit and MUST NOT be acted on by `spec-diff-fixer` — fixing them would either re-add removed content (defeating the finding's purpose) or remove content from the still-canonical session-model paragraph (crossing the scope guard above and pre-empting T15a's commit). Treat any such finding as `ignore — out-of-scope`.

## Relationships

- T15a "Reduce Session-model Orientation paragraph to a four-sentence forward-linking bullet" — co-resolve (the reduction at Orientation must land alongside this relocation).
- T15c "Lift Session-model scope deferrals into Non-goals (V1) section" — co-resolve (sibling restructure of the same paragraph).
- T14 "Prompt-mode sequentiality argument has an unstated fourth premise" — must-follow (the three premises being relocated are the ones T14 needs to extend with the fourth premise; the relocation is the natural moment to add it).
- T20 "Resource exhaustion under concurrent subagent invocations is undisclaimed for non-memory classes" — must-follow (the admission-cap disposition being relocated is the surface T20 needs the resource-exhaustion answer on).
- T19a "Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId" — same-cluster (lives in the same architectural area being created here; co-resolve siblings T19b/c/d/e also relevant).

## T13 — Invocation depth bound: introductory sentence omits the "cross-file" qualifier on `.warp fn` calls

> **PARKED** — 2026-05-18
> **Reason:** The inner spec-diff-fix-loop's severity-weighted triage exited on must-fix-blocked-by-scope-guard (plan §Change A clause 1 escape): a raised lens finding outranked this originating finding in importance, but every viable remediation would violate a class-1 or class-2 scope guard forwarded from the top-level fixer. FIXCOUNTS: 0,0. Loop notes: must-fix-blocked-by-scope-guard. Pass-3 classifier blocked one blocker (clarity/testability T1) — every remediation crosses the single [default] scope guard forbidding edits to the *countable-frame* paragraph. Reshape: relax the scope guard to permit a minimal `cross-file` definition, or split T13 to first install the definition then realign the three phrasing sites.. A human must resolve the guard-vs-severity collision (relax the guard, split this finding so the higher-importance raised finding is no longer downstream of the guard, or accept the trade-off and annotate the raised finding as out-of-scope) before re-introducing this finding.

# T13 — Invocation depth bound: introductory sentence omits the "cross-file" qualifier on `.warp fn` calls

**Kind:** naming
**Importance:** high
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The "Invocation depth bound" subsection of `docs/spec_topics/invocation.md` defines the same rule twice with different breadth. Its introductory paragraph enumerates the countable dispatches as direct `invoke(...)`, `.loom` callable calls through `tools:`, and `.warp` `fn` invokes — omitting the `cross-file` qualifier that the normative *countable-frame* paragraph immediately below applies to `.warp` `fn` calls. The qualifier is load-bearing: without it, intra-`.warp`-file `fn` dispatch is wrongly read as consuming a depth slot, so two implementers reading the subsection in order arrive at incompatible 32-slot budgets. The same loose phrasing has already propagated to the V18n leaf's *Adds.* bullet in `docs/plan_topics/v18-cancellation.md`.

## Solution approach

Rewrite the enumeration in the introductory paragraph of the "Invocation depth bound" subsection of `docs/spec_topics/invocation.md` so its third item reads "cross-file `.warp` `fn` calls" — adding the `cross-file` qualifier and matching the noun (`calls`) used by the normative *countable-frame* paragraph that follows. Apply the same wording change to the *Adds.* bullet of V18n in `docs/plan_topics/v18-cancellation.md`. Leave the normative *countable-frame* paragraph and the rest of the subsection unchanged.

## Solution constraints

- None.

## Relationships

## T12 — Dual-cap simultaneous breach: `<cap>` value in `loom/load/discovery-slow` diagnostic is indeterminate

> **PARKED** — 2026-05-18
> **Reason:** The inner spec-diff-fix-loop diverged: the most recent pass produced more fix-class findings than the previous one. FIXCOUNTS: 3,3,2,1,0,1,2. Loop notes: Divergence at pass 7 (fixCounts 1→2 between p6 and p7). Pass-6 anchor-split introduced fresh critique surface; pass-7 fixes discarded. Originating T12 was addressed by top-level fixer; divergence is in the loop's own refinement. Reshape: move tie-break sub-rule into a sibling subsection under `## Package discovery`.
> **Forensic report:** .pi/tmp/spec-fix-failure-forensics/2026-05-17T16-41-31_b4324e/t12-dual-cap-simultaneous-breach-cap-value-in-loom-load-discovery-slow-diagnosti.md

# T12 — Dual-cap simultaneous breach: `<cap>` value in `loom/load/discovery-slow` diagnostic is indeterminate

**Kind:** testability
**Importance:** high
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The "Package discovery" → "Edge cases" bounded-walk paragraph in `docs/spec_topics/discovery.md` says the walk stops on `looms.scanPackagesMaxFiles` or `looms.scanPackagesTimeoutMs` "whichever fires first" and emits a single `loom/load/discovery-slow` warning naming "the cap that fired", but both predicates are evaluated against the same observed state at the same cap-check site (before each new candidate-package read). When both predicates first become true on the same iteration — constructible deterministically via the `FakeClock` seam — the spec does not say which is consulted first, so the warning's `cap` payload is indeterminate. Two compliant implementations would emit different `cap` strings for the same input scenario, breaking any test fixture or operator log-analysis that keys on the field. The asymmetric ordering rule already stated later in the same paragraph for the per-read deadline / global timeout interaction shows the authors recognise the need to nail down such overlaps; the dual-cap case at the cap-check site itself was missed.

## Solution approach

Clarify the bounded-walk paragraph under "Edge cases" in the "Package discovery" section of `docs/spec_topics/discovery.md` by adding a tie-breaking rule for the simultaneous-true case at the cap-check site: the file-count predicate is evaluated before the elapsed-time predicate, so when both predicates are true at the same iteration the warning's `cap` field is `looms.scanPackagesMaxFiles`. Leave the per-read deadline / global timeout ordering rule already stated later in the same paragraph unchanged — that race is at a different site and already has its ordering nailed down.

## Solution constraints

- Do not introduce a new `cap` value, a third diagnostic code, or a new `details` field — the tie-break must resolve to one of the existing two cap names.
- Test-vector additions to plan leaf V14m in `docs/plan_topics/v14-tool-calls.md` are out of scope here.
