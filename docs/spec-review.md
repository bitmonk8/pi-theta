# T19a — Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** multiple
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry shape declared under `id="active-invocation-registry"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` carries no per-invocation correlation key — its current `Set<{ loomAbort: AbortController; disposeBarrier: Promise<void>; shutdownReason: string | undefined; loom: string }>` shape lets two concurrent sibling invocations of the same loom be indistinguishable on every downstream operator surface that reads from the registry. Sibling T19b adds an `invocation_id` wire field to `RuntimeEvent`, T19c widens the always-log dedup tuple to include it, and T19d populates `details.event.invocation_id` on the per-invocation `cancelled-by-session-shutdown` emission — all three rely on a canonical registry-side source for the id that does not yet exist. Without a per-entry id minted at registry-insertion time, none of the sibling consumers can populate or dedup on a stable per-invocation discriminator, and same-tick sibling fan-out collapses on every operator surface regardless of how the wire shape evolves.

## Solution approach

Extend the `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape `Set<...>` declaration under `id="active-invocation-registry"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` with a required `invocationId: string` member, and pin in the section's contract paragraph that each entry's `invocationId` is sourced via `crypto.randomUUID()` at the registry-insertion site (slash-command handler entry, `tool.execute(...)` adapter entry, and `invoke` spawn-site entry) inside the existing **Dispatch-site setup wrap** `try`/`catch` before any awaitable work, and is set on entry creation and never mutated thereafter. The exact identifier name, type, derivation primitive, and insertion-site placement are the substance of the change and are pinned as part of the registry-shape extension.

## Solution constraints

- Preserve the existing entry-shape members (`loomAbort: AbortController`, `disposeBarrier: Promise<void>`, `shutdownReason: string | undefined`, `loom: string`) verbatim — same name, type, optionality marker, and order.
- Do not introduce a parallel id channel and do not re-derive an id at any downstream emission site; T19c's dedup-key widening and T19d's `details.event.invocation_id` population both depend on a single registry-sourced value.
- The `RuntimeEvent` `invocation_id` wire field, the always-log dedup-tuple widening, the `cancelled-by-session-shutdown` details addition, and the real-time sibling emission-timing paragraph are owned by T19b, T19c, T19d, and T19e respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code, `details.kind` discriminator, aggregation surface, or storm-detection layer.

## Relationships

- T19b "Add invocation_id field to RuntimeEvent payload declaration" — co-resolve.
- T19c "Widen always-log dedup key to include invocation_id" — co-resolve.
- T19d "Populate cancelled-by-session-shutdown details with invocation_id" — co-resolve.
- T19e "Add real-time sibling emission timing paragraph" — co-resolve.
- T20 "Resource exhaustion under concurrent subagent invocations is undisclaimed for non-memory classes" — same-cluster.
- T18a "Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel" — must-precede (any decision to add operator-visibility for successful sibling outcomes will reuse the `invocation_id` field this child installs).
- T15a "Reduce Session-model Orientation paragraph to a four-sentence forward-linking bullet" — same-cluster.

# T19b — Add invocation_id field to RuntimeEvent payload declaration

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** multiple
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `type RuntimeEvent = { ... }` declaration in the **Runtime event channel** section of `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`, introduced by the sentence pinning the shape as "normative and additive-only", carries no per-invocation correlation field. Sibling T19a sources an `invocationId` from the `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry, but the wire payload has no destination for that value, so operator-side consumers of the always-log channel cannot distinguish concurrent-sibling emissions from the same loom. T19c's dedup-key widening and T19d's cancelled-by-session-shutdown details population both read this field and require it to be present on the wire shape.

## Solution approach

Add a required `invocation_id: string` field to the `type RuntimeEvent = { ... }` declaration in the **Runtime event channel** section of `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`. Rely on the existing "normative and additive-only" sentence above the declaration to characterise the addition; do not re-author that contract note here. Do not edit the surrounding prose, the dedup-tuple statements, or any sibling-owned surface.

## Solution constraints

- Preserve every existing `RuntimeEvent` field (`kind`, `code`, `loom`, `query_site`, `message`, `attempts`, `tokens_used`, `masked`, `occurred_at`) verbatim — same name, type, optionality marker, inline comment, and order.
- The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape change, the dedup-tuple widening, the cancelled-by-session-shutdown details addition, and the sibling timing paragraph are owned by T19a, T19c, T19d, and T19e respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code, `details.kind` discriminator, aggregation surface, or storm-detection layer.

## Relationships

- T19a "Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId" — co-resolve (this child consumes the field T19a sources).
- T19c "Widen always-log dedup key to include invocation_id" — co-resolve.

- T19e "Add real-time sibling emission timing paragraph" — co-resolve.
- T20 "Resource exhaustion under concurrent subagent invocations is undisclaimed for non-memory classes" — same-cluster.

# T19d — Populate cancelled-by-session-shutdown details with invocation_id

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** multiple
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `Per-invocation operator visibility (clean-cancel path)` rule under `id="session-shutdown-semantics"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` pins the per-invocation `finally`'s `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` emission as the teardown-time operator-visibility surface, currently populating `details.event.reason` (read from the registry entry's `shutdownReason`) and `details.event.loom` (read from the registry entry's `loom`). Sibling T19a extends `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entries with an `invocationId` field and sibling T19b adds `invocation_id` to `RuntimeEvent`, but the cleanly-cancelled per-invocation note has no spec rule pinning that `details.event.invocation_id` is populated. Without it, cleanly-cancelled concurrent siblings of the same loom collapse onto the same operator-stream row at teardown even after the registry source and wire field exist. The `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` row in `docs/spec_topics/diagnostics.md` and the nesting convention under `id="session-shutdown-details-conventions"` in the same file inherit the same gap on the diagnostics-side surface.

## Solution approach

Extend the `Per-invocation operator visibility (clean-cancel path)` rule under `id="session-shutdown-semantics"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` to pin that the per-invocation `finally`'s `cancelled-by-session-shutdown` emission populates `details.event.invocation_id` by reading the registry entry's `invocationId` field (the same channel by which `details.event.loom` is read), not by re-deriving an id at the emission site. Mirror the addition in the `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` row of `docs/spec_topics/diagnostics.md` and in the nesting-convention paragraph under `id="session-shutdown-details-conventions"` in the same file if and only if those locations enumerate the `details.event` field set; otherwise carry no diagnostics-side enumeration drift.

## Solution constraints

- Source `details.event.invocation_id` from the `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry's `invocationId` field on the per-invocation `finally` (the same channel by which `details.event.loom` is read); do not re-derive an id at the emission site and do not introduce a parallel id channel.
- Preserve the existing `details.event.reason` clauses (the `"quit" | "reload" | "new" | "resume" | "fork" | string` type pin, the four captured-value cases under the **Unknown-reason rule**, the `"<unreadable>"` sentinel rules including the post-deadline residual-gap arm) and the `details.event.loom` clause textually unchanged.
- The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape change, the `RuntimeEvent` wire-field addition, the dedup-key widening, and the real-time timing paragraph are owned by T19a, T19b, T19c, and T19e respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code or `details.kind` discriminator.

## Relationships

- T19a "Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId" — co-resolve (this child reads the registry entry T19a defines).
- T19b "Add invocation_id field to RuntimeEvent payload declaration" — co-resolve.
- T19c "Widen always-log dedup key to include invocation_id" — co-resolve.
- T19e "Add real-time sibling emission timing paragraph" — co-resolve.

# T19e — Add real-time sibling emission timing paragraph

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** multiple
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The **Runtime event channel** section in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` pins exactly-once-per-origin emission semantics for `loom-system-note` always-log notes and lists Deduplication and lifetime rules, but does not pin emission timing across concurrent sibling invocations. An implementer reading the section could legally batch sibling always-log emissions until the parent's tool-loop round closes — deferring operator-visible failure timing — without violating any existing rule on the page. The omission also leaves V18q's concurrent-sibling emission tests without a normative anchor for whether sibling failures must surface in real time at the originating site.

## Solution approach

Extend the **Runtime event channel** section in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` to pin the emission timing of sibling always-log notes on `loom-system-note`. The section must establish that each sibling emission surfaces in real time at its originating site (batching across the parent's tool-loop round is not permitted), with V18q's concurrent-sibling tests as the binding behavioural anchor. The relative interleaving order across concurrent sibling origins follows the host JavaScript runtime's event-loop scheduling and is operator-observable; no test asserts a specific cross-sibling interleaving sequence.

## Solution constraints

- Do not relocate or reword the existing paragraphs in the section.
- The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape change, the `RuntimeEvent` `invocation_id` wire field, the dedup-key widening, and the cancelled-by-session-shutdown details change are owned by T19a, T19b, T19c, and T19d respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code, `details.kind` discriminator, aggregation surface, or storm-detection layer.

## Relationships

- T19a "Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId" — co-resolve.
- T19b "Add invocation_id field to RuntimeEvent payload declaration" — co-resolve.
- T19c "Widen always-log dedup key to include invocation_id" — co-resolve.
- T19d "Populate cancelled-by-session-shutdown details with invocation_id" — co-resolve.
- T20 "Resource exhaustion under concurrent subagent invocations is undisclaimed for non-memory classes" — same-cluster.

# T11a — Replace "consumes one slot" prose with explicit forced-respond exemption rule

**Kind:** testability
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The *Tool-call loop bound* section in `docs/spec_topics/query.md` (anchor `tool-call-loop-bound`) and the `tool_loop` field paragraph in `docs/spec_topics/frontmatter.md` each assert that the forced respond turn for a typed query consumes one `tool_loop` slot. That framing contradicts CIO-4 in `docs/spec_topics/hard-ceilings.md` and its *Depth-6 forced respond at `max_rounds`* worked consequence, which together treat the forced respond turn as the unconditional terminating mechanism CIO-4's `max_rounds`-final branch routes to (slot-accounting is evaluated only against free-phase rounds). At `max_rounds: 0` the contradiction is directly observable: under the "consumes one slot" reading the only available turn is already over budget; under CIO-4 it MUST still be dispatched. The sibling findings T11b and T11c cannot land their V6k changes against the spec until this prose is reconciled.

## Solution approach

Rewrite the relevant sentences in the *Tool-call loop bound* section of `docs/spec_topics/query.md` and in the `tool_loop` field paragraph of `docs/spec_topics/frontmatter.md` to replace the "consumes one slot" framing with an explicit forced-respond-exemption rule: the forced respond turn is the typed-query terminating mechanism CIO-4's `max_rounds`-final branch routes to; the runtime MUST dispatch it on every typed query that reaches that branch (including the `max_rounds: 0` boundary case, where it is the only turn issued); and CIO-4's slot-accounting check is not evaluated against the forced respond turn itself. Confirm `docs/spec_topics/hard-ceilings.md` CIO-4 and the *Depth-6 forced respond at `max_rounds`* worked consequence remain aligned with the new rule and leave them unedited if they do.

## Solution constraints

- Treat `docs/spec_topics/hard-ceilings.md` (CIO-4 and the *Depth-6 forced respond at `max_rounds`* worked consequence) and PIC-1 (d) in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` as read-only — they are already aligned with the new rule.
- Plan leaves V6k and V6l in `docs/plan_topics/v6-typed-queries.md` are owned by T11b and T11c — out of scope here.

## Relationships

- T11b "V6k counting-formula tighten: forced respond outside the budget" — must-precede (the prose rule must land before V6k's formula can be rewritten against it).
- T11c "V6k normative test vector for `max_rounds: 0` typed query" — must-precede (the prose rule must land before V6k's test can assert against it).

# T03a — Add `**Loom-package implementation dependencies (V1).**` sub-paragraph in PIC `Host prerequisites`

**Kind:** assumptions, completeness
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `**Host prerequisites.**` paragraph in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` enumerates four host-side prerequisites (Pi SDK pin, Binder model, Binder credentials, Pi-supplied `AbortSignal`) and does not name the loom package's own production dependencies needed to satisfy the Step 0 probe contracts. The runtime's `semver` dependency is mentioned only inside the parentheticals of the two `*Recommended recipe (non-normative).*` paragraphs immediately below the enumeration, both explicitly labelled non-normative. Consequently the H1 leaf's `dependencies["semver"]` manifest assertion (per `docs/plan_topics/h1-scaffold.md`) has no normative anchor in PIC to assert against.

## Solution approach

Add a new sub-paragraph whose lead bold token is `**Loom-package implementation dependencies (V1).**` immediately below the four-item enumeration in `**Host prerequisites.**` of `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`. The sub-paragraph names the V1 implementation choices the recipe contracts consume — for V1, `semver` declared in the loom package's `dependencies` block and `@types/semver` declared in `devDependencies` — frames the choices as implementation-side rather than normative contract, and states the chosen version range as a literal value.

## Solution constraints

- Do not introduce a new MUST about which SemVer implementation contributors must use; the comparator-swap escape hatch already promised by the two `*Recommended recipe (non-normative).*` paragraphs must remain genuine after this sub-paragraph lands.

## Relationships

- T03c "Trim dependency-pinning parentheticals from PIC's two `*Recommended recipe (non-normative).*` paragraphs" — must-precede (this finding installs the anchor that obviates the parentheticals T03c removes).
- T03f "`h1-scaffold.md` manifest assertion: anchor at the new PIC sub-paragraph ..." — must-precede (T03f's manifest assertion anchors at the sub-paragraph this finding installs).

# T10 — Single-string bypass: behaviour on whitespace-only / absent slash argument is unspecified

**Kind:** testability
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The *Single-string bypass* clause (item 2 of *Binder bypass*, anchor `bypass-cases`) in `docs/spec_topics/binder.md` is silent on the case where the user supplies no slash argument or supplies only whitespace. After the documented leading/trailing-whitespace trim, the bound value is `""`, and AJV with the default `string` schema accepts it, but the bypass path has no binder fallback, no `needs_info` channel, and no reserved diagnostic for this case — so two reasonable implementers diverge on whether the loom starts with `""` bound or whether the runtime emits a system note and suppresses the loom. The choice is load-bearing for the user-visible surface and for V3c's test matrix in `docs/plan_topics/v3-frontmatter.md`, which currently has no row pinning the empty-trim outcome.

## Solution approach

Clarify item 2 of *Binder bypass* in `docs/spec_topics/binder.md` to pin the chosen behaviour: when the slash argument is absent or trims to the empty string, the param is bound to `""` and the loom starts; AJV validates `""` against the `string` schema (it passes by definition). Add a paired test row to V3c's *Tests* line in `docs/plan_topics/v3-frontmatter.md` asserting that the no-argument and whitespace-only-argument cases both bind the param to `""` and start the loom.

## Solution constraints

- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code, a new failure-mode-template row, or a new system-note template — the resolution is to clarify the bound value and start condition only.
- Do not alter the existing trim semantics: leading/trailing whitespace stripped, internal whitespace preserved (e.g. `/foo  hello  ` still binds `"hello"`).
- Do not change echo policy on the bypass path — echo auto-suppression on bypass per V16k must continue to hold for the absent / whitespace-only cases.
- The *No-params overflow* note in `docs/spec_topics/slash-invocation.md` must remain gated on `params: {}` / absent; do not extend it to fire on the single-string bypass path.
