# T11a — Replace "consumes one slot" prose with explicit forced-respond exemption rule

**Kind:** testability
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The *Tool-call loop bound* section in `docs/spec_topics/query.md` (anchor `tool-call-loop-bound`) and the `tool_loop` field paragraph in `docs/spec_topics/frontmatter.md` each assert that the forced respond turn for a typed query consumes one `tool_loop` slot. That framing contradicts CIO-4 in `docs/spec_topics/hard-ceilings.md` and its *Depth-6 forced respond at `max_rounds`* worked consequence, which together treat the forced respond turn as the unconditional terminating mechanism CIO-4's `max_rounds`-final branch routes to (slot-accounting is evaluated only against free-phase rounds). At `max_rounds: 0` the contradiction is directly observable: under the "consumes one slot" reading the only available turn is already over budget; under CIO-4 it MUST still be dispatched. The sibling findings T11b and T11c cannot land their V6k changes against the spec until this prose is reconciled.

## Solution approach

Rewrite the relevant sentences in the *Tool-call loop bound* and *Typed queries are tool-loop-shaped* sections of `docs/spec_topics/query.md`, in the `tool_loop` field paragraph of `docs/spec_topics/frontmatter.md`, in the *tool-call round slot accounting* entry of `docs/spec_topics/glossary.md`, and in the *Issuing typed queries* bullet of `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` (the sentence beginning "The forced respond turn counts against the same `tool_loop.max_rounds` cap" — this sentence sits in the *Conversation drive* section and is distinct from PIC-1 (d), which remains read-only per the constraint below) to replace the "consumes one slot" framing with an explicit forced-respond-exemption rule: the forced respond turn is the typed-query terminating mechanism CIO-4's `max_rounds`-final branch routes to; the runtime MUST dispatch it on every typed query that reaches that branch (including the `max_rounds: 0` boundary case, where it is the only turn issued); and CIO-4's slot-accounting check is not evaluated against the forced respond turn itself. Confirm `docs/spec_topics/hard-ceilings.md` CIO-4 and the *Depth-6 forced respond at `max_rounds`* worked consequence remain aligned with the new rule and leave them unedited if they do.

## Solution constraints

- Treat `docs/spec_topics/hard-ceilings.md` (CIO-4 and the *Depth-6 forced respond at `max_rounds`* worked consequence) and PIC-1 (d) in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` as read-only — they are already aligned with the new rule.
- Plan leaves V6k and V6l in `docs/plan_topics/v6-typed-queries.md` are owned by T11b and T11c — out of scope here.

## Relationships

- T11b "V6k counting-formula tighten: forced respond outside the budget" — must-precede (the prose rule must land before V6k's formula can be rewritten against it).
- T11c "V6k normative test vector for `max_rounds: 0` typed query" — must-precede (the prose rule must land before V6k's test can assert against it).

# T03a — Add `**Loom-package implementation dependencies (V1).**` sub-paragraph in PIC `Host prerequisites`

**Kind:** assumptions, completeness
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced
**Decision axes:** 3

## Problem

The `**Host prerequisites.**` paragraph in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` enumerates four host-side prerequisites (Pi SDK pin, Binder model, Binder credentials, Pi-supplied `AbortSignal`) and does not name the loom package's own production dependencies needed to satisfy the Step 0 probe contracts. The runtime's `semver` dependency is mentioned only inside the parentheticals of the two `*Recommended recipe (non-normative).*` paragraphs immediately below the enumeration, both explicitly labelled non-normative. Consequently the H1 leaf's `dependencies["semver"]` manifest assertion (per `docs/plan_topics/h1-scaffold.md`) has no normative anchor in PIC to assert against.

## Solution approach

Add a new sub-paragraph whose lead bold token is `**Loom-package implementation dependencies (V1).**` immediately below the four-item enumeration in `**Host prerequisites.**` of `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`. The sub-paragraph names the V1 implementation choices the recipe contracts consume — for V1, `semver` declared in the loom package's `dependencies` block and `@types/semver` declared in `devDependencies` — frames the choices as implementation-side rather than normative contract, and states the chosen version range as a literal value.

## Solution constraints

- Do not introduce a new MUST about which SemVer implementation contributors must use; the comparator-swap escape hatch already promised by the two `*Recommended recipe (non-normative).*` paragraphs must remain genuine after this sub-paragraph lands.

## Relationships

- T03c "Trim dependency-pinning parentheticals from PIC's two `*Recommended recipe (non-normative).*` paragraphs" — must-precede (this finding installs the anchor that obviates the parentheticals T03c removes).
- T03f "`h1-scaffold.md` manifest assertion: anchor at the new PIC sub-paragraph ..." — must-precede (T03f's manifest assertion anchors at the sub-paragraph this finding installs).

# T16e — PIC step 2 internal contradiction: literal `pi.setActiveTools([...snapshot, ...names])` call shape vs natural-language "exactly the loom's declared callable set"

**Kind:** consistency
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

Step 2 of the `Around each query` enumeration under **Tool-registration lifetime and visibility** in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` reads: ``Call `pi.setActiveTools([...snapshot, ...loomCallableSetNames, respondToolName?])` — the set the model sees for this turn is exactly the loom's declared callable set, plus the respond tool when the turn is a typed-query response turn.`` The literal call argument `[...snapshot, ...loomCallableSetNames, respondToolName?]` produces the **union** of the user-session snapshot and the loom's declared callable set (plus optionally the respond tool); the natural-language gloss that immediately follows asserts that the set the model sees is **exactly** the loom's declared callable set (plus optionally the respond tool), which excludes the snapshot. The two sentences are mutually exclusive — either the snapshot is part of the model's visible set for the turn or it is not — and a reader cannot determine which shape is normative. T16b's reshape of the `docs/spec.md` Trust-boundary callable-set paragraph depends on PIC owning a single, coherent prompt-mode visibility rule to forward-link to; with both shapes live in the cited owner section, T16b cannot characterise prompt-mode visibility without inheriting the contradiction.

## Solution approach

Resolve the contradiction at the source by picking one shape for prompt-mode query visibility under **Tool-registration lifetime and visibility** in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`. Either (a) rewrite the natural-language gloss in step 2 to match the literal `[...snapshot, ...loomCallableSetNames, respondToolName?]` call — the set the model sees is the user-session snapshot unioned with the loom's declared callable set (and the respond tool on a typed-query response turn), keeping the snapshot/restore protocol's existing behaviour explicit; or (b) rewrite the literal call to match the natural-language gloss — `pi.setActiveTools([...loomCallableSetNames, respondToolName?])` with no snapshot union — and adjust the surrounding paragraphs (the `If another extension calls pi.setActiveTools` consequence in the same section, and any downstream `spec.md`-side framing of the per-mode callable-set rule) accordingly. Pick whichever shape is intended by the V1 prompt-mode design; do not introduce a third shape and do not preserve both.

## Solution constraints

- Do not widen the V1 prompt-mode callable surface beyond what one of the two existing shapes already authorises; the resolution picks between (a) snapshot-union (current literal call) and (b) snapshot-replaced (current natural-language gloss).
- Do not introduce a new type, a new SDK call, or a new `details.kind` discriminator; the edit is a prose / call-literal reconciliation inside the existing step 2.
- Do not touch the subagent-mode `createAgentSession({ customTools, ... })` paragraph; subagent-mode visibility is a separate mechanism unaffected by this contradiction.
- The `docs/spec.md` Trust-boundary callable-set paragraph is owned by T16b — out of scope here.

## Relationships

- T16b "Rewrite callable-set paragraph: drop inline `customTools` / `createAgentSession` / `pi.setActiveTools` names" — must-precede (T16b's prompt-mode visibility characterisation cannot land until PIC step 2 owns a single coherent rule for it to forward-link to).

# T19a — Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** multiple
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry shape declared under `id="active-invocation-registry"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` carries no per-invocation correlation key — its current `Set<{ loomAbort: AbortController; disposeBarrier: Promise<void>; shutdownReason: string | undefined; loom: string }>` shape lets two concurrent sibling invocations of the same loom be indistinguishable on every downstream operator surface that reads from the registry. Sibling T19b adds an `invocation_id` wire field to `RuntimeEvent`, T19c widens the always-log dedup tuple to include it, and T19d populates `details.event.invocation_id` on the per-invocation `cancelled-by-session-shutdown` emission — all three rely on a canonical registry-side source for the id that does not yet exist. Without a per-entry id minted at registry-insertion time, none of the sibling consumers can populate or dedup on a stable per-invocation discriminator, and same-tick sibling fan-out collapses on every operator surface regardless of how the wire shape evolves.

## Solution approach

Extend the `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape `Set<...>` declaration under `id="active-invocation-registry"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` with a required `invocationId: string` member, and pin in the section's contract paragraph that each entry's `invocationId` is established at the registry-insertion site (slash-command handler entry, `tool.execute(...)` adapter entry, and `invoke` spawn-site entry) inside the existing **Dispatch-site setup wrap** `try`/`catch` before any awaitable work, and is set on entry creation and never mutated thereafter. The identifier follows the corpus's existing `<invocation-id>` / `<uuid>` convention (see [Diagnostics — Identifier-, descriptor-, and closed-enum placeholders](./diagnostics.md#7-identifier-descriptor-and-closed-enum-placeholders)); the name, type, and set-once semantics are load-bearing because the co-resolve siblings T19b/c/d depend on a single registry-sourced value.

## Solution constraints

- Preserve the existing entry-shape members (`loomAbort: AbortController`, `disposeBarrier: Promise<void>`, `shutdownReason: string | undefined`, `loom: string`) verbatim — same name, type, optionality marker, and order.
- Do not introduce a parallel id channel and do not re-derive an id at any downstream emission site; T19c's dedup-key widening and T19d's `details.event.invocation_id` population both depend on a single registry-sourced value.
- The `RuntimeEvent` `invocation_id` wire field, the always-log dedup-tuple widening, and the `cancelled-by-session-shutdown` details addition are owned by T19b, T19c, and T19d respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code, `details.kind` discriminator, aggregation surface, or storm-detection layer.

## Relationships

- T19b "Add invocation_id field to RuntimeEvent payload declaration" — co-resolve.
- T19c "Widen always-log dedup key to include invocation_id" — co-resolve.
- T19d "Populate cancelled-by-session-shutdown details with invocation_id" — co-resolve.
- T20 "Resource exhaustion under concurrent subagent invocations is undisclaimed for non-memory classes" — same-cluster.
- T18a "Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel" — must-precede (any decision to add operator-visibility for successful sibling outcomes will reuse the `invocation_id` field this child installs).

# T19b — Add invocation_id field to RuntimeEvent payload declaration

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** multiple
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `type RuntimeEvent = { ... }` declaration in the **Runtime event channel** section of `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`, introduced by the sentence pinning the shape as "normative and additive-only", carries no per-invocation correlation field. Sibling T19a sources an `invocationId` from the `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry, but the wire payload has no destination for that value, so operator-side consumers of the always-log channel cannot distinguish concurrent-sibling emissions from the same loom. T19c's dedup-key widening and T19d's cancelled-by-session-shutdown details population both read this field and require it to be present on the wire shape.

## Solution approach

Add a required `invocation_id: string` field to the `type RuntimeEvent = { ... }` declaration in the **Runtime event channel** section of `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`. Rely on the existing "normative and additive-only" sentence above the declaration to characterise the addition; do not re-author that contract note here.

## Solution constraints

- Preserve every existing `RuntimeEvent` field (`kind`, `code`, `loom`, `query_site`, `message`, `attempts`, `tokens_used`, `masked`, `occurred_at`) verbatim — same name, type, optionality marker, inline comment, and order.
- The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape change, the dedup-tuple widening, and the cancelled-by-session-shutdown details addition are owned by T19a, T19c, and T19d respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code, `details.kind` discriminator, aggregation surface, or storm-detection layer.

## Relationships

- T19a "Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId" — co-resolve (this child consumes the field T19a sources).
- T19c "Widen always-log dedup key to include invocation_id" — co-resolve.
- T19d "Populate cancelled-by-session-shutdown details with invocation_id" — co-resolve.
- T20 "Resource exhaustion under concurrent subagent invocations is undisclaimed for non-memory classes" — same-cluster.
- T18a "Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel" — must-precede.

# T19d — Populate cancelled-by-session-shutdown details with invocation_id

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Score:** 100
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** multiple
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `Per-invocation operator visibility (clean-cancel path)` rule under `id="session-shutdown-semantics"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` pins the per-invocation `finally`'s `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` emission as the teardown-time operator-visibility surface, currently populating `details.event.reason` (read from the registry entry's `shutdownReason`) and `details.event.loom` (read from the registry entry's `loom`). Sibling T19a extends `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entries with an `invocationId` field and sibling T19b adds `invocation_id` to `RuntimeEvent`, but the cleanly-cancelled per-invocation note has no spec rule pinning that `details.event.invocation_id` is populated. Without it, cleanly-cancelled concurrent siblings of the same loom collapse onto the same operator-stream row at teardown even after the registry source and wire field exist. The `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` row in `docs/spec_topics/diagnostics.md` and the nesting convention under `id="session-shutdown-details-conventions"` in the same file inherit the same gap on the diagnostics-side surface.

## Solution approach

Extend the `Per-invocation operator visibility (clean-cancel path)` rule under `id="session-shutdown-semantics"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` to pin that the per-invocation `finally`'s `cancelled-by-session-shutdown` emission populates `details.event.invocation_id` by reading the registry entry's `invocationId` field (the same channel by which `details.event.loom` is read), not by re-deriving an id at the emission site. Mirror the addition in the `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` row of `docs/spec_topics/diagnostics.md` and in the nesting-convention paragraph under `id="session-shutdown-details-conventions"` in the same file if and only if those locations enumerate the `details.event` field set; otherwise carry no diagnostics-side enumeration drift.

## Solution constraints

- Source `details.event.invocation_id` from the `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry's `invocationId` field on the per-invocation `finally` (the same channel by which `details.event.loom` is read); do not re-derive an id at the emission site and do not introduce a parallel id channel.
- Preserve the existing `details.event.reason` clauses (the `"quit" | "reload" | "new" | "resume" | "fork" | string` type pin, the four captured-value cases under the **Unknown-reason rule**, the `"<unreadable>"` sentinel rules including the post-deadline residual-gap arm) and the `details.event.loom` clause textually unchanged.
- The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape change, the `RuntimeEvent` wire-field addition, and the dedup-key widening are owned by T19a, T19b, and T19c respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code or `details.kind` discriminator.

## Relationships

- T19a "Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId" — co-resolve (this child reads the registry entry T19a defines).
- T19b "Add invocation_id field to RuntimeEvent payload declaration" — co-resolve.
- T19c "Widen always-log dedup key to include invocation_id" — co-resolve.
- T20 "Resource exhaustion under concurrent subagent invocations is undisclaimed for non-memory classes" — same-cluster.
- T18a "Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel" — must-precede.
